The main aim was to extract evolutionary knowledge from protein structures via a structural alignment tool and in-house 2-stage hierarchical clustering so we can obtain the structural regions of protein that has been preserved throughout the evolution. An example of such color-coded regions can be seen below for protein 1f6m_E.
